<h1>How to use JavaScript and the Twitch.tv API for to create a custom browsing experience</h1>
<p>This guide will overview how to make use of the Twitch.tv API to expand on the browsing experience provided through Twitch's user interface.</p>
<p>Contents:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Set up Twitch account and obtain Client ID</li>
	<li>Create a successful GET request with Twitch</li>
	<li>Use a web page to display results</li>
	<li>Perform multiple searches from one screen</li>
	<li>Search across different twitch content types</li>
</ol>

<h2>Set up Twitch account and obtain Client ID</h2>
<p>You will need your own Client ID to establish web service communication with Twitch.  Follow these steps to get your Client ID</p>
<ol>
	<li>Go to the Twitch.tv home page.  Log in if you have an account - if not sign up for a free account.</li>
	<li>Go to the Settings page, and then to the Connections tab.  At the bottom of the page, click "Register your Application" and complete the form.</li>
	<li>Once completed the form will provide you with your Client ID.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Create a successful GET request with Twitch</h2>
<p>Before setting up a web page, test to ensure you can successfully communicate with Twitch.  Chrome's Advanced Rest Client works well for this purpose.  Create a GET request as shown in the screenshot below, adding your Client ID as the "Client-ID" header.  Ensure you get a response back that is not an error.</p>

<h2>Use a Web Page to Display Results</h2>
<p>The below jsfiddle is an example of using the Twitch API to get results of the most popular live streams by game.  The JavaScript used in the example does the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Form the http request tested in step 2.  In this example we ask for streams rather than clips.  Documentation on what can be requested through the API is on the Twitch website.</li>
	<li>Execute the response, then parse the JSON response text.</li>
	<li>Loop through the response and create a preview element for item returned.  Add in the elements you want to display, including informations about the item and/or links to the content.</li>

<h2>Perform Multiple Searches from One Screen</h2>
<p>In the next jsfiddle, we copy the functions to create and handle the GET request to search across multiple games at the same time.</p>
