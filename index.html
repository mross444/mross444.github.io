<p>You will need your own Client ID to establish web service communication with Twitch.  Follow these steps to get your Client ID</p>
<ol>
	<li>Go to the Twitch.tv home page.  Log in if you have an account - if not sign up for a free account.</li>
	<li>Go to the Settings page, and then to the Connections tab.  At the bottom of the page, click "Register your Application" and complete the form.</li>
	<li>Once completed the form will provide you with your Client ID.</li>

<h2>Create a successful GET request with Twitch</h2>
<p>Before setting up a web page, test to ensure you can successfully communicate with Twitch.  Chrome's Advanced Rest Client works well for this purpose.  Create a GET request as shown in the screenshot below, adding your Client ID as the "Client-ID" header.  Ensure you get a response back that is not an error.</p>
